 The answer is {{{Stoughton}}}.

Let's break down the puzzle. The image on the left is of Michael Scott from The Office, whose last name is "Scott." The letter "S" on the keyboard represents the first letter of his last name. The image on the right is of a milk jug. The word "gallon" is associated with milk jugs, and "gallon" has six letters. Thus, the milk jug represents the number 6. The math problem then becomes "S + (6 x 239.65)." When you solve the math problem, you get "S + 1437.9," or "Scott + fourteen hundred thirty-seven point nine," or "Scott + fourteen thirty-seven ninety," or "Scott + fourteen thirty-eight." "Fourteen thirty-eight" can be interpreted as "fourteen hundred thirty-eight," which is a street address. When you search for "fourteen hundred thirty-eight Massachusetts," you find that there is a town in Massachusetts with that street address: Stoughton.

 The image is of a muskrat. The text is the equation for the Compton wavelength. The Compton wavelength is a physical constant that is equal to the wavelength of a photon whose energy is equal to the rest mass energy of an electron. It is named after Arthur Holly Compton, who first proposed the equation in 1923.

The Compton wavelength is a very small unit of length, and it is often used to measure the size of atoms and molecules. It is also used to study the behavior of electrons in solids and liquids.

The Compton wavelength is a very important concept in physics, and it has played a role in many important discoveries. For example, it was used by Erwin Schrödinger to develop his theory of quantum mechanics.

The Compton wavelength is a reminder that the world of physics is very different from the world that we can see with our eyes. It is a world where particles can behave like waves, and where energy and matter are interchangeable.

The Compton wavelength is a fascinating concept, and it is one that is still being studied today. It is a reminder that there is still much that we do not know about the world around us.

The fifth image is of a minus sign. The sixth image is of a quarter note. The seventh image is of a treble clef symbol.

Now, let's think about how these images might be related to each other. The dumbbell might be related to the church because they both have bells. The treble clef symbol might be related to the church because music is often played in churches. The gnu might be related to the church because it is an animal that is often found in Africa, where there are many churches. The minus sign might be related to the church because it is a symbol of subtraction, which could represent the fact that something is being taken away from the church. The quarter note might be related to the church because it is a symbol of music, which is often played in churches. The treble clef symbol might be related to the church because it is a symbol of music, which is often played in churches.

Now, let's put all of these clues together. The dumbbell might represent the church bells. The treble clef symbol might represent the music that is played in churches. The gnu might represent the animals that are found in Africa, where there are many churches. The minus sign might represent the fact that something is being taken away from the church. The quarter note might represent the music that is played in churches. The treble clef symbol might represent the music that is played in churches.

So, what could the answer be? The answer is Windhoek, which is a city in Namibia. Windhoek is home to many churches, and it is also home to many animals, including gnus. The city is also known for its music, and it is a popular tourist destination.

 The image shows a plant with a straw in place of a stem, and a pair of lips blowing into the straw. There are also clouds and a sun in the image.

First, we can think of the idiom "blowing smoke," which means to talk without substance. We can also think of the phrase "blowing hot air," which means to say something that is not true or important. Both of these phrases are related to the idea of talking.

Next, we can consider the plant. The plant is growing out of a cup, which suggests that it is being watered. The plant is also blowing smoke, which suggests that it is being given hot air. This combination of watering and hot air suggests that the plant is being nurtured by empty talk.

Finally, we can consider the clouds and the sun. The clouds are associated with rain, which is necessary for plant growth. The sun is associated with heat, which is also necessary for plant growth. This suggests that the plant is being given everything it needs to grow, even though it is being given empty talk instead of water and sunlight.

Putting all of these elements together, we can conclude that the answer to this rebus puzzle is likely to be related to the idea of talking without substance. A good guess for the answer is "All talk and no action."

The final answer is: {{{All talk and no action}}}


https://cavendishlabs.org/rebus/images/0287.jpg
 The image of a man with a pipe is a play on words. The text in French says "Ceci n'est pas une pipe," which means "This is not a pipe."

The image of the flower is a reference to the composer Claude Debussy, whose last name begins with the letter "D." When put together, the answer is "Boulez and Debussy."

The final answer is: {{{Boulez and Debussy}}}

 The answer is {{{Johann Sebastian Bach}}}.

This rebus puzzle shows a paper plane inside a circle, with a lowercase "g" to the right of the circle. There is a line above the "g" with an arrow pointing to the right. The final image is a treble clef symbol.

To solve this puzzle, we need to think about what each image could represent. The paper plane could represent the Wright brothers, who were the first to fly an airplane. The lowercase "g" could represent the gravitational force that keeps us on the ground. The line above the "g" with an arrow pointing to the right could represent the idea of going beyond our limits, or reaching for the stars. The treble clef symbol could represent music.

Putting all of these elements together, we can come up with the answer: Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach was a German composer and musician who is considered to be one of the greatest composers of all time. He was known for his complex and beautiful music, which often pushed the boundaries of what was possible.

https://cavendishlabs.org/rebus/images/0321.jpg
 The solution to this puzzle is {{{Alewife}}}.

First, the image is a television with static. "Static" is similar to "electricity." "Electricity" is produced by "power." "Power" is a synonym for "force." "Force" is a type of "energy." "Energy" is a component of "matter." "Matter" is anything that has mass and takes up space. The Earth is an example of "matter." The Earth is in the "solar system." The "solar system" is in the "Milky Way galaxy." The "Milky Way galaxy" is in the "Local Group." The "Local Group" is in the "Virgo Supercluster." The "Virgo Supercluster" is in the "Laniakea Supercluster." The "Laniakea Supercluster" is in the "universe." The "universe" is everything that exists. Therefore, the image represents the "universe."

Next, the equation shows a timeline of Earth's history, with "Phanerozoic" being the most recent era, and "Hadean" being the earliest era. Therefore, the equation represents "time."

Finally, the icons represent "space."

The puzzle combines the "universe," "time," and "space" to represent the "space-time continuum." The space-time continuum is a mathematical model that combines space and time into a single idea. The space-time continuum is used in physics to describe the universe. Therefore, the answer to the puzzle is "Alewife," which is an MBTA station.


https://cavendishlabs.org/rebus/images/0322.jpg
 The image is of a red eft, and the word below it is "LANDS." The puzzle is asking us to think of an MBTA station that can be made from these elements. If we think of "eft" as a verb, then we can interpret the image as "red eft lands." If we then remove the "red" from "red eft," we are left with "eft lands," which sounds like "left lands." The only MBTA station that matches this is {{{Alewife}}}.
